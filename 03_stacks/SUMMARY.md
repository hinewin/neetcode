# Stacks

A stack is a data structure that contains a collection of elements where you can add and delete elements from just one end (called the top of the stack). In the physical world, a stack can be conceptualized by thinking of plates at a dinner party buffet. When you go to take a plate, you can only remove from the top and similarly when you finish your meal, the stack of plates can only be built by adding them on top of each other â€” this is exactly what a stack in the software world does.

Stacks are a dynamic data structure that operate on a LIFO (Last In First Out) manner. The last element placed inside is the first element that comes out. The stack supports three operations - push, pop, peek.

## Push

Push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, which in dynamic array terms would be appending an element to the end. This is an efficient `O(1)` operation as discussed in the previous chapters. It helps to visualize a stack as an array that is vertical. The pseudocode demonstrates the concept, along with the visual where we add numbers from `1` to `4` to the top. The top pointer updates to point at the last item added. The following pseudocode and visual demonstrates this.

```python
def push(self, n):
    # using the pushback function from dynamic arrays to add to the stack
    self.stack.append(n)
```

Stack, as a data structure, is just an abstract interface and it does not really matter how you implement it - the characteristics are just that you should be able to add and remove elements from the same end. Since a stack will remove elements in the reverse order that it inserted them in, it can be used to reverse sequences - such as a string, which is just a sequence of characters.

## Pop

Pop operation removes the last element from top of the stack, which in dynamic array terms would be retrieving the last element. This is also an efficient `O(1)` operation as discussed in the previous chapters. Taking the previous example, let's say we wish to pop `4` and `5`. The pseudocode below demonstrates the concept, along with the visual where we remove `4` and `5` from the top. Again, the top pointer updates to point at the last item.

```python
def pop(self):
    return self.stack.pop()
```

In most languages, before popping, it is a good measure to check if the stack is empty to avoid errors.

## Peek

Peek is the simplest of three. It just returns, without removing, the top most element.
```python
def peek(self):
    return self.stack[-1]
```
